The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\\n\\n         2.2      Shipment.

In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer's  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor's  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor's   minimum.

Provider shall continue performing the Services in accordance with this Agreement pending resolution of any dispute.\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2.4 No Right of Setoff. Each of the Parties hereby acknowledges that it shall have no right under this Agreement to offset any amounts owed (or to become due and owing) to the other Party, whether under this Agreement, the Purchase Agreement or otherwise, against any other amount owed (or to become due and owing) to it by the other Party. 3.

Any Party (the \\\"Non-Breaching Party\\\") may terminate this Agreement with respect to any Service, in whole but not in part, at any time upon prior written notice to the other Party (the \\\"Breaching Party\\\"), if the Breaching Party has failed (other than pursuant to Section 3.6) to perform any of its material obligations under this Agreement relating to such Service, and such failure shall have continued without cure for a period of 30 days after receipt by the Breaching Party of a written notice of such failure from the Non-Breaching Party seeking to terminate such service. For the avoidance of doubt, non-payment by Recipient for a Service provided by Provider in accordance with this Agreement and not the subject of a good-faith dispute shall be deemed a breach for purposes of this Section 3.3. 3.4 Insolvency. In the event that either Party hereto shall (a) file a petition in bankruptcy, (b) become or be declared insolvent, or become the subject of any proceedings (not dismissed within sixty (60) days) related to its liquidation, insolvency or the appointment of a receiver, (c) make an assignment on behalf of all or substantially all of its creditors, or (d) take any corporate action for its winding up or dissolution, then the other party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by providing written notice in accordance with Section 6.6. 3.5 Effect of Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement in its entirety pursuant to Section 3.1, all obligations of the Parties hereto shall terminate, except for the provisions of Section 2.2, and the entirety of Sections 4, 5 and 6, which shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement. 3.6 Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, Provider shall promptly: (a) Deliver to Recipient all documents, work product, and other materials, whether or not complete, prepared by or on behalf of Provider in the course of performing the Services for which Recipient has paid.

(f) Permanently erase all of Recipient's Confidential Information from its computer systems. (g) Certify in writing to Recipient that it has complied with the requirements of this Section 3.6 3.7 Force Majeure. If Provider is prevented from or delayed in complying, either totally or in part, with any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement by reason of fire, flood, storm, strike, lockout or other labor trouble or shortage, delays by unaffiliated suppliers or carriers, shortages of fuel, power, raw materials or components, any law, order, proclamation, regulation, ordinance, demand, seizure or requirement of any governmental authority, riot, civil commotion, war, rebellion, acts of terrorism, nuclear accident or other causes beyond the reasonable control of Provider, or acts, omissions, or delays in acting by any governmental or military authority or Recipient (each, a \\\"Force Majeure\\\"), then upon written notice to Recipient, the Services affected by the Force Majeure (the \\\"Affected Services\\\") and/or other requirements of this Agreement will be suspended during the period of such Force Majeure and Provider will have no liability to Recipient or any other party in connection with such Affected Services. If the Force Majeure in question prevails for a continuous period in excess of three months after the date on which the Force Majeure begins, Provider shall be entitled to give notice to Recipient to terminate the Affected Services. The notice to terminate must specify the termination date, which must be not less than ten (10) days after the date on which the notice to terminate is given. Once a notice to terminate has been validly given, the Affected Services will terminate on the termination date set out in the notice. Neither Party shall have any liability to the other in respect of termination of the Affected Services due to Force Majeure, but rights and liabilities which have accrued prior to termination shall subsist.\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4. Confidentiality. 4.1 Confidentiality. During the term of this Agreement and thereafter, the Parties hereto shall, and shall instruct their respective representatives to, maintain in confidence and not disclose the other Party's financial, technical, sales, marketing, development, personnel, and other information, records, or data, including, without limitation, customer lists, supplier lists, trade secrets, designs, product formulations, product specifications or any other proprietary or confidential information, however recorded or preserved, whether written or oral (any such information, \\\"Confidential Information\\\"). Each Party hereto shall use the same degree of care, but no less than reasonable care, to protect the other Party's Confidential Information as it uses to protect its own Confidential Information of like nature. Unless otherwise authorized in any other agreement between the Parties, any Party receiving any Confidential Information of the other Party (the \\\"Receiving Party\\\") may use Confidential Information only for the purposes of fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement (the \\\"Permitted Purpose\\\"). Any Receiving Party may disclose such Confidential Information only to its representatives who have a need to know such information for the Permitted Purpose and who have been advised of the terms of this Section 4.1 and the Receiving Party shall be liable for any breach of these confidentiality provisions by such Persons; provided, however, that any Receiving Party may disclose such Confidential Information to the extent such Confidential Information is required to be disclosed by law, in which case the Receiving Party shall promptly notify, to the extent possible, the disclosing party (the \\\"Disclosing Party\\\"), and take reasonable steps to assist in contesting such disclosure requirement or in protecting the Disclosing Party's rights prior to disclosure, and in which case the Receiving Party shall only disclose such Confidential Information that it is advised by its counsel in writing that it is legally bound to disclose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, \\\"Confidential Information\\\" shall not include any information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate: (a) was publicly known at the time of disclosure to it, or has become publicly known through no act of the Receiving Party or its representatives in breach of this Section 4.1, (b) was rightfully received from a third party without a duty of confidentiality, or (c) was developed by it independently without any reliance on the Confidential Information. 4.2 Return of Confidential Information. Upon demand by the Disclosing Party at any time, or upon expiration or termination of this Agreement with respect to any Service, the Receiving Party agrees promptly to return or destroy, at the Disclosing Party's option, all Confidential Information received in connection with this Agreement. If such Confidential Information is destroyed, an authorized officer of the Receiving Party shall certify to such destruction in writing. 5. Indemnification. 5.1 Indemnification. Provider shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Recipient and its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, successors, and permitted assigns (collectively, \\\"Indemnified Party\\\") against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including attorneys' fees, fees and the costs of enforcing any right to indemnification under this Agreement, and the cost of pursuing any insurance providers, incurred by Indemnified Party or awarded against Indemnified Party (collectively, \\\"Losses\\\"), relating to/arising out of or resulting from any claim of a third party or Recipient arising out of or occurring in connection with Provider's negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of this Agreement. Provider shall not enter into any settlement without Recipient's or Indemnified Party's prior written consent. 6. Miscellaneous. 6.1 Entire Agreement.
